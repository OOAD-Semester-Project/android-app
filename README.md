# Copy Once Paste Anywhere - Android App Repo

## Introduction:

We have built a solution for synchronizing the clipboard content (any copied text, or URL) across all the devices a user has logged in. There are two types of applications for users - Android app and Web app. The user has to simply login to these devices in order to use our system. Whenever a user copies some text in any of their logged-in devices, it is copied on all of their other devices, ready to be pasted. This makes it much more convenient for users to transfer content from one device to another.

The is the GitHub repository of the Android app of our project. You can install the [APK](https://github.com/OOAD-Semester-Project/android-app/raw/master/base.apk) on your Android smartphone and try it out! (*Requires Android 9 or lower*)
